## Real Estate Price Prediction Project
This project focuses on building a machine-learning model to predict real estate prices. It involves utilizing various data science techniques and tools such as Python, pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, and Flask.

Introduction
The project aims to address real-life challenges faced by data scientists working in companies like Zillow or Magic Bricks. It explores the steps involved in building a real estate price prediction model and provides valuable insights into the data science process.

Project Overview
Dataset: The project utilizes a dataset containing features such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and location data obtained from sources like Zillow.
Website Development: A website for predicting home prices is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle to architect the project.
Machine Learning Model: Various machine learning algorithms are explored to build the prediction model. Data cleaning, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and outlier removal are performed to enhance model performance.
Flask Server: A Python Flask server is created to serve the prediction model. Data is exported to a pickle file for storage and retrieval, and HTTP endpoints are exposed to handle different requests.
Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used for the project.
pandas: Used for data cleaning and manipulation.
Matplotlib: Utilized for data visualization.
scikit-learn: Used for building and evaluating machine learning models.
Flask: Used to create a web server for serving the prediction model.
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Employed for website development and user interface.
Learning Opportunities
This project provides valuable learning opportunities in server-side web development and data science. It serves as an engaging project to apply machine learning and data science concepts in a real-world scenario.
