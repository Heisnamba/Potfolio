# Real Estate Price Prediction Project
This project focuses on building a machine-learning model to predict real estate prices. It involves utilizing various data science techniques and tools such as Python, pandas, Matplotlib and scikit-learn

## Introduction
The project aims to address real-life challenges faced by data scientists working in companies like Zillow or Magic Bricks. It explores the steps involved in building a real estate price prediction model and provides valuable insights into the data science process.

## Project Overview
Dataset: The project utilizes a dataset containing features such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and location data obtained from sources like Zillow.
Machine Learning Model: Various machine learning algorithms are explored to build the prediction model. Data cleaning, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and outlier removal are performed to enhance model performance.

## Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used for the project.
pandas: Used for data cleaning and manipulation.
Matplotlib: Utilized for data visualization.
scikit-learn: Used for building and evaluating machine learning models.
