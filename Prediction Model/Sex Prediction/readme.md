# Height Prediction Model README
## Overview
This repository contains a basic prediction model to estimate an individual's height based on their weight. Additionally, the model uses logistic regression to predict the sex (male/female) based on the provided features.

## Features
Height: The target variable to be predicted.
Weight: The feature used for predicting the height.
Sex: The target variable predicted using logistic regression.

## Performance Metrics
To evaluate the model's performance, the following metrics were used:

* F1 Score: A measure of a model's accuracy that considers both precision and recall.
* Accuracy: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
* Confusion Matrix: A table used to describe the performance of the classification model.
* Recall: The proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified.
* Precision: The proportion of correct identifications.

#### The model demonstrates a basic approach to predicting height based on weight and predicting sex using logistic regression. The performance metrics provide insights into the model's accuracy and reliability, which can be further improved with additional feature engineering and model tuning.
